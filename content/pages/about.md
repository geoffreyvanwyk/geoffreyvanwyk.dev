## About Me

I am a computer programmer working remotely from a small town in the
[Northern Cape][nc] province of South Africa. My primary programming language has
been [PHP][php]. For the last number of years I have been working mostly on
[Moodle][m], deploying it, modifying it, creating custom plugins for our clients,
modifying existing plugins, site administration and troubleshooting. Even though
I am not with my former employer anymore where I worked on Moodle, I continue to
work on it in terms of [Ansible][a] roles for setting it up, software services,
working on plugins and participating in the community chat rooms and forums,
taking courses on [Moodle Academy][ma] to stay up-to-date.

Besides the secondary programming languages that are obligatory for a web
developer (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bash, SQL), I also enjoy learning other
languages like Racket, Clojure, Haskell, Elixir, etc.

I had fun writing web scrapers in [Python][py] and have decided to make it my primary
language moving forward because, besides the fact that I like the language
philosophy and syntax, there are many libraries available for it for all types
of programming.

When I am not programming, I play the saxophone, play [chess][c] online, or learn
other human languages like Latin on [Duolingo][duo] and from books.
