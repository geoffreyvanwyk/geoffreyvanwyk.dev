Title: About

My first introduction to computer programming was in the form of [Fortran][1] in a first-year second-semester module at the University of Stellenbosh in the 1990s. Computer programming was only one half of the module; the other half was dedicated to [mass balances][2] in chemical engineering.

During class I could not follow the lecturer, partly because he was not speaking loudly or clearly enough and partly because this was a completely new concept for me. If I missed something he said earlier in the lecture, what he said later was a mystery. There was no prescribed book, and the booklet that accompanied the course was not helpful at all.

Eventually I realized there must be a book about Fortran in the library of the engineering faculty. I found one! From that point onwards course was smooth sailing for me.
